## About Me
I am a Computer Science MSc student researching evolutionary computation at McMaster University, supervised by Dr. Stephen Kelly. Prior to this, I completed undergraduate degrees in Computer Science specializing in AI with a minor in Statistics at the University of Windsor.

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, movies, art, and playing the violin.
