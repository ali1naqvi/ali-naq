## About Me

I’m a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at McMaster University, co-supervised by Stephen Kelly and Reuven Dukas. My research explores how animal-like behaviour emerges and evolves in artificial living systems. I’m especially interested in the evolutionary origins of biological complexity and how it manifests across levels of organization, from microbes like *E. coli* to multicellular organisms.

Before starting the PhD, I completed my MSc at McMaster. Outside the lab, you’ll usually find me reading, watching films, or playing the violin.
