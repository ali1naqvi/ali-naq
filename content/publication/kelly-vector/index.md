abstract: Tangled Program Graphs (TPGs) are highly modular, hierarchical rep-
resentations for genetic programming that are well-suited to multitask learning in
visual reinforcement learning and temporal sequence prediction domains. In this
work, we describe how TPGs can evolve versatile problem solvers that are capa-
ble of solving multiple problems from different domains simultaneously. A single
evolved solver can predict actions in discrete and continuous control tasks, as well
as perform generative time-series prediction. All tasks are partially observable and
explicitly require the solvers to dynamically update an internal mental model of the
environment at runtime. We test an expanded set of memory types and operations,
and show how they benefit TPGs without significant additional computational cost.
